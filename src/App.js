              <h1>TEAM KILL PASS TRACKER</h1>
              <p>
                The beginnings of an EPIC Rainbow Six Siege (and other
                multiplayer game) Team Kill Pass system.
              </p>

              <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
              <p>
                To be completely <s>hecking</s> honest, I do not know.
              </p>
              <p>
                Actually, to be realer than real, I made this system because I
                was inspired by a guy named yeboizaidey on Discord to do so. He
                sorta started a TK Pass "honor system" that just grew into a
                giant meme. Zaidey also tried to convince me that making this
                website was all a big waste of time, but I did not listen
                because I am always up for a challenge.
